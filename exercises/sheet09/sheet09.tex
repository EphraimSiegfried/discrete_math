\section*{Exercise \homeworkNumber.1}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item This statement is false. This will be shown with a counterexample.Let \( G =  (\left\{ a,b,c \right\},\left\{ \left\{ a,b \right\}, \left\{ b,c \right\}  \right\}    \). G is connected, because we can reach every vertex from every vertex. The Graph \( G' = (\left\{ a,c \right\}, \emptyset) \) is an induced subgraph of \( G \), since it is formed from a subset of the vertices from \( G \) and the vertices \( a,c \) are not connected in \( G \). \( G' \) is not connected. We have the case that \( G \) is connected but the induced graph \( G' \) is not connected. Therefore the statement is false.
	\item This statement is correct. A forest is a graph without cycles, essentially a collection of trees. An induced subgraph of a forest will also be cycle-free, as removing vertices and their associated edges cannot create a cycle where there was none before. Therefore, any induced subgraph of a forest is also a forest.
	\item If a graph is a tree, then it must also be connected. Because the statement in a) is false, this statement must also be false, i.e. it is not guaranteed that an induced graph of a connected graph is connected. But this would be required for the statement: "If G is a tree, then all its induced subgraphs are trees. "

\section*{Exercise \homeworkNumber.3}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The graph \( G \) has 2 cycles \( \left\{ \left\{ J , N, L \right\}, \left\{ L, I, K \right\} \right\} \) of length 3. The given graph has three cycles \( \left\{ 1,2,4 \right\}, \left\{ 4,7,6 \right\}, \left\{ 6,7,8 \right\}  \) of length 3. The graphs don't have the same properties and are therefore not isomorphic.

	\item \( \sigma = \left\{ H \to 2, J \to 5, N \to 8, L \to 4, O \to 7, K \to 3, I \to 6, M \to 1 \right\}  \)
